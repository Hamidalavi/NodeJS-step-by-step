# Cookies & Sessions

In this file, you will learn about: Cookies & Sessions

- What is a Cookie
- Setting a Cookie
- Configuring Cookies
- Introduction to Sessions
- Using Session with Middleware
- Using MongoDB to Store Sessions
- Deleting a Cookie

## What is a Cookie

Consider we have `User` (client) and the Server (Node App); for example, we have a form there to add a new product, we submit a request to our Node server. That request requires us to store some kind of data in the browser (e.g. login page).

For example, when the user logs in, we want to store the information that the user is logged in; somewhere, that when the user reloads the page and therefore technically a new request is sent, we still have that information around that the user is logged in. For that, we can send back a cookie with the response we send back upon the request.

**Note**: Cookies are stored on the client-side.

Before you work with them, make sure you installed `ejs`, `express` and `body-parser` packages with: `npm install --save express ejs body-parser`.

## Start our Project

Consider this example:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  req.isLoggedIn = false;
  res.render("auth", { pageTitle: "Login", isAuthenticated: req.isLoggedIn });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.isLoggedIn = true;
  res.render("auth", { pageTitle: "Login", isAuthenticated: req.isLoggedIn });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```html
<!-- auth.ejs - in `views` folder -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <% if (isAuthenticated) { %>
                <li>Admin</li>
             <% } %>
                <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <form action="/login" method="POST">
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <input type="password" name="password">
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We added a custom request (i.e. `isLoggedIn`) above and set a value for that two times (`false` and `true`). However, if the user submit a form (click on a submit button), the `Admin` will be displayed (otherwise not).

But if the user close the window and want to open this page again, he/she can't see the `Admin` anymore.

We must collect the user's information and save them. With that, the user can logs in and see his/her `Admin` in navigation.

## Setting a Cookie

With cookies, we store data in the browser of a single user and store data in that browser which is customized to that user which does not affect all the other users; but can be sent with requests to tell us "hey, I already am authenticated".

So, consider this example:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", "nothing");
  res.render("main");
});

app.get("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  const isLoggedIn = req.get("Cookie").split("=")[1];
  console.log(isLoggedIn); // the splitted cookie value
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", "true");
  res.redirect("/login");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```html
<!-- main.ejs - in `views` folder -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Main page</title>
</head>

<body>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/login">Login</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</body>

</html>
```

```html
<!-- login.ejs - in `views` folder -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <% if (isAuthenticated === "true") { %>
                <li>Admin</li>
                <% } %>
                    <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <form action="" method="POST">
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <input type="password" name="password">
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, we added a `loggedIn` cookie with `"nothing"` value and it happens in the root path (i.e. `localhost:3000`). We also render the `main.ejs` content in there.

**Note1**: If we didn't add a custom cookie, it would be fail; because in the next middleware, we want to get cookie's value (i.e. `req.get("Cookie").split("=")[1];`) and store it into `isLoggedIn` constant. Now we set a cookie (with `"nothing"` value) in our browser. Then we inject our `isAuthenticated` with `"nothing"` value.

**Note2**: In the first time, this value is `"loggedIn=nothing"`. We split our string and convert it into `"nothing"`.

Then in the last middleware we change the cookie's value to `"true"` and finally the `Admin` will be displayed in navigation.

**Note3**: If now the user close the window and want to open this page again, he/she **can** see the `Admin`.

**Warning**: Some developers use `res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "isLoggedIn=true");` instead of `res.cookie("loggedIn", "true");`. It's do exact job. `res.cookie()` will automatically add `Cookie` header here this reason for `req.get("Cookie").split("=")[1];`. In this line, `Cookie` is `"nothing"` and when a user submit a form, this turns to `"true"`.

We can remove the `"true"` from `login.ejs` file near `if` statement. Then we add `===` strict equal sign near our cookie (near `split()[1]`):

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", "nothing");
  res.render("main");
});

app.get("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  const isLoggedIn = req.get("Cookie").split("=")[1] === "true"; // <-- this line
  console.log(isLoggedIn);
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", true); // <-- and this line -- we can also use "true" here
  res.redirect("/login");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Now `isLoggedIn` returns the `true` and `false` value and we coerce it to `"true"` string. It means that it only works if the value is `"true"`, otherwise is returns the `false` boolean value.

This is good, but it's not a best approach. Because all users can edit them in their browses, for example, then can easily change the `loggedIn` cookie to `"true"` and enter the website as `Admin`.

Cookies don't only have to relate to our page; a cookie can also be sent to another page and that is a common instrument in tracking where we have that so-called **tracking-pixel** on pages which is an image URL with no real image, but that image can be located on Google's servers and we have a cookie on that page which is also sent along with that, and therefore Google can track on which page we are and how we are moving through the web even if we're not on their websites. Because some data is stored in our client and obviously we could delete it therefore which is why we can block such mechanisms too, but it is stored there and it is sent with every request to Google, so they track us and you without we being on their server.

So storing that information on their servers would not work but storing it on our computer will work; because that can be sent on every page we visit.

## Configuring Cookies

We can add some options in our cookies. For example, we can add an expire date in our cookies. Consider that we want to remove a cookie after ten seconds:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", "nothing");
  res.render("main");
});

app.get("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  const isLoggedIn = req.get("Cookie").split("=")[1] === "true";
  console.log(isLoggedIn); // true or false
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", true, { maxAge: 1000 });
  res.redirect("/login");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Look at these lines:

```js
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", true, { maxAge: 1000 }); // <-- this line
  res.redirect("/login");
});
```

We set a max age for ten seconds (1000 milliseconds); with that, cookie will remove after ten seconds.

**Warning**: Some developers use `res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "isLoggedIn=true; Max-Age=10");`. This is exactly the same for `res.cookie(...)`.

**Note1**: In this configuration, `10` is a real second, not millisecond.

**Note2**: We can also use `Date()` object for date time.

We can secure our cookie (hide the value) with `secure` option:

```js
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", true, { secure: true });
  res.redirect("/login");
});
```

**Note1**: Our example would not work (doesn't show the `Admin`), because it would only be set if we are serving the page via `https`.

**Warning**: Some developers use `res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "isLoggedIn=true; Secure);`. This is exact same as `res.cookie(...)`.

We can allow that we can only use cookies in `http` protocol:

```js
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie("loggedIn", true, { httpOnly: true });
  res.redirect("/login");
});
```

**Warning**: This option looks like the `res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "isLoggedIn=true; httpOnly);`. With this option, we can't access the cookie value through client-side **JavaScript**. This can be an important security mechanism, because it protects us against cross-site scripting attacks; because now our client-side **JavaScript** where someone could have injected malicious code, can't read our cookie values. We cover it totally in the next topic.

**Note**: You can check the `httpOnly` in `HttpOnly` column in `Application` tab in developer tools. If you see `✓` mark in this column, that means this value is `true`.

## Getting Ready for Sessions

With session, we can store sensitive data on the server, not on the client.

Before we work with sessions, we need to install a third-party package that named `express-session`:

```bash
npm install --save express-session
```

We can import this module (package) with:

```js
const session = require("express-session");
```

We can configure the session setup with `session({})` in the middleware:

```js
app.use(session({secret: "my secret"}));
```

In this example, `secret` option will be used for signing the hash which secretly stores our ID in the cookie. We can enter any text here.

We should add the `resave` option and set this to `false`; this means that the session will not be saved on every request that is done, so on every response that is sent, but only if something changed in the session; this will improve performance and so on.

```js
app.use(session({secret: "my secret", resave: false}));
```

Then, the final option we must add it, is a `saveUninitialized` option and set this to `false`. This will ensure that no session gets saved for a request where it doesn't need to be saved, because nothing was changed about it.

```js
app.use(session({secret: "my secret", resave: false, saveUninitialized: false}));
```

We can also add cookie configuration here, for example, we want add expire date here:

```js
app.use(session({secret: "my secret", resave: false, saveUninitialized: false, cookie: {maxAge: 1000}}));
```

But we don't need it, so let's remove it for now.

## Using Session with Middleware

Consider these contents:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const session = require("express-session");

const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(
  session({ secret: "my secret", resave: false, saveUninitialized: false })
);

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: req.session.isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.isLoggedIn = true;
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```js
// login.ejs
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <% if (isAuthenticated) { %>
                <li>Admin</li>
                <% } %>
                    <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <form action="/login" method="POST">
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <input type="password" name="password">
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

Copy and paste (and look at them). The advantage of sessions over cookies is:

1. If we use session, we can store sensitive data in the backend.
2. We must not add a pre-cookie to load the page (i.e. `"nothing"` cookie in the Cookies section).
3. The request all totally individual from each other, totally separated and still we see `true` here if we console.log(`req.session.isLoggedIn)`. Because we still store this in the session on the server-side; by default, just in the memory, not in the database yet, and the session is indentified for current browser; because we have that cookie.
4. Sensitive information can be stored on the server, we cant' modify it.

**Note**: About the third advantage, all users are the same in Chrome and Edge browsers.

If we log the session with `console.log(req.session)`, we get this following text as output:

```js
Session {
  cookie: { path: '/', _expires: null, originalMaxAge: null, httpOnly: true },
  isLoggedIn: true
}
```

## Using MongoDB to Store Sessions

As we said before, we can store sessions in our database. We don't want to use memory store, because this way is less secure and it is less unlimited (i.e. it will reach limits when more users use our app).

Before we start with it, we need to install two packages. First one is `mongoose` which we worked with it (with MongoDB) and second one is `connect-mongodb-session`. We can install them with `npm install --save mongoose connect-mongodb-session` command.

For importing the `connect-mongodb-session` package, we can write:

```js
// app.js
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoDB = require("connect-mongodb-session")(session);
```

**Warning**: Make sure you pass the `session` constant here which you imported in `app.js` file.

Before we work with this package, make sure you connect your MongoDB database:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoDBStore = require("connect-mongodb-session")(session);

const URI =
  "mongodb+srv://hamid:1yN49snBKxXgzued@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
const app = express();
const store = new MongoDBStore({
  uri: URI,
  collection: "sessions"
});

app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(
  session({ secret: "my secret", resave: false, saveUninitialized: false })
);

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: req.session.isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.isLoggedIn = true;
  console.log(req.session);
  console.log(req.session.isLoggedIn);
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We created a `store` constant which is good for storing sessions in our database. In `store` constant, we instantiate a new `MongoDBStore` variable which is store the `require("connect-mongodb-session")(session)` value; and we can pass some options for that. For example, we can connect our database and store any sessions in our `sessions` collection in our MongoDB database.

You can copy and paste our code. If you go to your database you'll see the `sessions` collection. But this collection in empty; we can add our sessions into our collection with passing our `store` constant in `session({...})`, for example:

```js
// app.js
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "my secret",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: store
  })
);
```

Now if we press the `Login` button, the session will store in our database. For example:

```js
_id: "m3bRfPvQG1xEM48Y86HNhwORP1it10cz"
expires: 2021-01-13T02:50:41.892+00:00
session: Object // nested
```

**Note**: The expiration date is set to default, we can also set an expiration date in our `store` options.

With this powerful package, we can store data across requests while still scoping them to a single user and not sharing the data across users.

**Important**: So in general, use a session for any data that belongs to a user, that you don't want to lose after every response you send, and that should not be visible to other users. With this package you can feel smoothly.

## Deleting a Cookie

With the `connect-mongodb-session` package, we can remove the sessions easily. Before deleting a session from the client (and database), consider this EJS content:

```html
<!-- login.ejs - with `Logout` button -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <% if (isAuthenticated) { %>
                <li>Admin</li>
                <% } %>
                    <li>Users</li>
                    <form action="/logout" method="POST">
                        <button type="submit">Logout</button>
                    </form>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <form action="/login" method="POST">
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <input type="password" name="password">
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We add a new form with a `Logout` button in there. Don't think about the file name, because this is `login.ejs`.

Now in our `app.js` file, we want remove the session from our client and server when we click on `Logout` button in `login.ejs` file. We do that via `destroy()` method:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoDBStore = require("connect-mongodb-session")(session);

const URI =
  "mongodb+srv://hamid:1yN49snBKxXgzued@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
const app = express();
const store = new MongoDBStore({
  uri: URI,
  collection: "sessions"
});

app.set("view engine", "ejs"); // view engine
app.set("views", "views"); // path

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "my secret",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: store
  })
);

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("login", {
    pageTitle: "Login",
    isAuthenticated: req.session.isLoggedIn
  });
});

app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.isLoggedIn = true;
  console.log(req.session);
  console.log(req.session.isLoggedIn);
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.post("/logout", (req, res, next) => { // <-- this line
  req.session.destroy();
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We destroyed the session from our client (browser) and server (MongoDB database).

`destroy()` function takes a callback function and we can do the same stuff above with it:

```js
// app.js
app.post("/logout", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.destroy(error => {
    console.log(error);
    res.redirect("/");
  });
});
```

It work greatly, but the local cookie is still here in our client, but don't worry about that, this is a fake session here and main session was removed successfully. But you can use just `destroy()` method here.

**Note**: Make sure, you need pre-authenticated user to your website. For example, if there is no cookie here, the product page would not work currectly, or you can do some condition for your navigation, for example:

```html
<!-- login.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <% if (isAuthenticated) { %>
                <li>Admin</li>
                <form action="/logout" method="POST">
                    <button type="submit">Logout</button>
                </form>
                <% } %>
                    <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <form action="/login" method="POST">
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <input type="password" name="password">
        <% if (!isAuthenticated) { %>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
            <% } %>
    </form>
</body>

We said, if the user not logged in, the `Admin` item (from list item) and the `Logout` button will hide (do not exist). Once the user logged in, the `Admin` item and `Logout` button would be displayed.

**Note** Don't care about the styling, we just want to show you how cookies and sessions work.

**Note2**: Sometimes when we login into our website and when some buttons were loaded, we need to reload the page and see the different, but we don't want to reload the page. Sometimes we don't want the user see the `View the Full Screen` button before the logging in and once he/she logged in, he/she can't see this button; and when he/she reload the button button will be displayed. We need to fix this problem, we can fix this problem with `save()` method:

```js
// app.js
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.isLoggedIn = true;
  req.session.save(err => {
    console.log(err);
    res.redirect("/");
  });
});
```

We used this way instead if this following way:

```js
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  req.session.isLoggedIn = true;
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

Now the page will only continue once that session has been created.

## Summary

**Cookies**:

- Great for storing data on the client (browser).
- Do not store sensitive data here! It can viewed + manipulated.
- Cookies can be configured to expire when the browser is closed (i.e. Session Cookie) or when a certain age / expiry date is reached (i.e. Permanent Cookie).
- Works well together with Sessions; but they're not limited to using with sessions.

**Sessions**:

- Stored on the server, not on the client .
- Great for storing sensitive data that should survive across requests.
- We can can store anything in sessions.
- Often used for storing user data / authentication status (with `express-session` package).
- Identified by the Cookie (don't mistake this with the term **Session Cookie**).
- We can use different storages for saving our sessions on the server (e.g. MongoDB storage, MySQL storage, file storage and so on).
