How payments work?

1. Collect Payment Method
2. Verify Payment Method
3. Charge Payment Method
4. Manage Payments
5. Process Order in App

We have a third-party package which is called `stripe`.

Consider, we have our client-side and our server; in the client, we'll collect credit card data. We'll do that with the help of `stripe` and we'll send it to the `stripe` servers (which are not owned by us, but by that company) to validate that input.

Once it's valid, `stripe` will return a token to us which encoded. Then we send that token to our server (to our code), and we create a charge or we charge this payment method. Then with the help of `stripe` again.

After creating some objects, we get a response once this is done and then we can continue with our code and edit this or store this in the database and so on.

We don't want to work with that. Because we don't have this structure in our country. We work with Zarin-pal instead.
