# Modern NodeJS

In this file, you will learn about:

- ES Modules
- Promises in Core APIs

We can import and export files in newly version of **JavaScript** and most modern apps using this way and most modern browsers also support them. We can export something from one file to another file with `export const doSomething = () => { .. };` and then we import it in that other file with `import { doSomething } from "my-file";`.

In this file you'll learn about new syntax of export and importing the packages. We don't want to use `module.exports`, `require("...")`, `exports = {..}` and so on anymore.

Instead we want to work with `import` keyword (i.e. ES Module) here. There are three ways of using `import` in **Node.js**, we can't use it manually. Before we introducing them, let's make an example here:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const responseHandler = require("./response-handler");

const app = express();

app.get("/", responseHandler);

app.listen(3000);
```

```js
// response-handler.js
const fs = require("fs");

module.exports = handler = (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile("my-page.html", "utf8", (err, data) => { // one dummy content
    res.send(data);
  });
};
```

## Ways of Importing Packages

**One way** of using these imports, is that we rename our files **from `.js` to `.mjs`**. So we can change the file extension to `mjs` instead of `js` where the `m` stands for module. For example, we can rename our files to `app.mjs`

**The second alternative**, is that we keep `.js` as a file extension. In the nearest `package.json` file, we should make sure that the `"type"` property (i.e. configuration or Node) is set to `"module"`. So consider:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "nodejs-step-by-step",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "type": "module", // <-- this line
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

```js
// app.js
// const express = require("express");
import express from "express";
const responseHandler = require("./response-handler");

const app = express();

app.get("/", responseHandler);

app.listen(3000);
```

If we run this app, we still an error which is `ReferenceError: require is not defined`. Because since we set our type to `module`, we have to use the new `import` and `export` syntax everywhere. So we also need to change the code one more time:

```js
// app.js
// const express = require("express");
// const responseHandler = require("./response-handler");
import express from "express";
import responseHandler from "./response-handler";

const app = express();

app.get("/", responseHandler);

app.listen(3000);
```

If we run this app again, we still an error which is `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module /path...`. Can you guess why?

Because as we said before, we have to use the new `import` and `export` syntax everywhere. We need to change the export syntax in `response-handler.js` file:

```js
// response-handler.js
// const fs = require("fs");
import fs from "fs";

const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile("my-page.html", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    res.send(data);
  });
};

export default handler;
```

OMG! we have an error with the previous message; because we need to add file extension here:

```js
// app.js
// const express = require("express");
// const responseHandler = require("./response-handler");
import express from "express";
import responseHandler from "./response-handler.js"; // <-- this line

const app = express();

app.get("/", responseHandler);

app.listen(3000);
```

**Warning**: We don't need to add extension for third-party modules, but for our own files we have to add it.

If we have multiple things that we want to export, we can't use `export default`. **Because that is only usable once per file**. We can export multiple things just with `export` keyword:

```js
// response-handler.js
// const fs = require("fs");
import fs from "fs";

export const handler = (req, res, next) => { // <-- this line
  fs.readFile("my-page.html", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    res.send(data);
  });
};
```

We can also use a different way:

```js
// response-handler.js
// const fs = require("fs");
import fs from "fs";

const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile("my-page.html", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    res.send(data);
  });
};

export { handler };
```

Now the importing is a bit different:

```js
// app.js
// const express = require("express");
// const responseHandler = require("./response-handler");
import express from "express";
import { handler } from "./response-handler.js";

const app = express();

app.get("/", handler);

app.listen(3000);
```

We put the exported function name here which is `handler` between `{}` curly braces.

**Note**: With the `export default` syntax, the name was up to us; we could also just named `hand` or whatever we like. With a named export where we have the `export` keyword right in the line where we define a constant or variable (first way we mean), **the name is no longer up to us**. Now we need to `{}` curly braces and we need to use the exact name of what was exported then.

## More on ES Module

We want to read a `html` file in a different way:

```js
// response-handler.js
export const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile("my-page.html");
};
```

If we run this app, we would get an error which is `TypeError: path must be absolute or specify root to res.sendFile`. So we need to import the `path` module here:

```js
// response-handler.js
import path from "path";

export const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "my-page.html"));
};
```

The problem is here, the `__dirname` is undefined here; the error is `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined`. It was a global variable reused multiple times throughout the course and it just worked. With the modern ES module syntax, it does not work anymore; because there are no globals anymore with this syntax.

We must import a pseudo global variable with the different way:

```js
// response-handler.js
import path, { dirname } from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

export const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "my-page.html"));
};
```

In this code above, the `path` is the default module we worked with it as before.

The `fileURLToPath()` function ensures the correct decodings of percent-encoded characters as well as ensuring a cross-platform valid absolute path string. In the other words, **It provides the absolute path string for us**.

And `dirname()` returns the directory name of a path. We can store the previous absolute path string to it. It's it similar to the Unix `dirname` and `pdw` Linux command.

## Fun Time

We can also use import the core **JavaScript** objects with their function; for example, we can eject the `log()` function from the `console` object:

```js
// app.js
import { log } from "console";
log("Hamid"); // "Hamid"
```

Now we can just write `log(...)` instead of `console.log()` in here.

You can be creative and make more fun with **Node.js** and **JavaScript** world.

## Promises

We can turn the core module into a promise based. For example, we want to convert `fs` to promised based with `fs/promises`:

```js
// response-handler.js
import fs from "fs/promises";

export const handler = (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile("my-page.html", "utf-8")
    .then(data => {
      res.send(data);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
};
```

Now it's better look and we can esasily check this code.

**Note1**: If we want to import the Promised based `fs` with normal syntax, we need to write `const fs = require("fs").promises;`.

**Note2**: With this promised based core module API (i.e. `fs`), a raw file of HTML content now will be downloaded and we don't know why.
