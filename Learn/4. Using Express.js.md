# Express.js

In this file, you will learn about:

- What is Express.js
- Using Middleware
- Working with Requests & Responses with Express
- Routing
- Returning HTML page (File)

We use this framework because we want to focus on our business logic, not on the nitty-gritty details!

**Q**: What is framework?

**Answer**: Helper functions, tools and rules that help us build our application. This is a papular framework for **Node.js**. With this framework, we can write code more readable and easier.

## Using Express

First of all, we need to install Express framework with `npm install --save express` command (production mode).

**Note**: Make sure you did the `npm init` configuration.

Then we see:

```json
{
  "name": "http_modern",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Complete Node.js Course",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.6"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

We can import our express framework with `require()`:

```js
const express = require("express");
```

Thereafter we need to add the main app of express framework:

```js
const app = express();
```

It exports a function here (use `ctrl + mouseLeftClick`), and therefore we execute it as a function and this will initialize a new object.

This gives us such a app object which in the end is an object with a lot of features and functions provided by express.

<!-- The amazing feature is that the express and `app` object therefore sets up the server for us behind the scenes. It means that we only need to write: -->

## Adding Middleware

Middleware means that an incoming request is automatically funneled through a bunch of functions by express.js. So instead of just having one request handler, we'll actually have a possibility of hooking in multiple functions which the request will go through until we send a response.

This allows us to split our code into multiple blocks or pieces instead of having one huge function that does everything; and this is the pluggable nature of express.js, where we can easily add other third-party packages which happen to give us such middleware functions that we can plug into express.js and add certain functionalities.

We can use the `app` and call a method which is defined by the express framework, the `use()` method:

```js
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use();

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

`use()` method allows us to add a new middleware function. It accepts an array of so-called **request handlers** and it has some other use cases too.

Now one easy way of using it, is that we pass a function to it and this function will be executed for every incoming request:

```js
app.use(() => {});
```

This function will receive three arguments; the **request** and the **response** object and the third argument which is the **next** argument:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {});
```

**Note1**: You know the request and the response objects.
**Note2**: The `next` argument is a callback function which we call it.

This `next` function has to be executed to allow the request to travel on to the next middleware. Consider:

```js
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In the middleware");
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

It works well. But if we use two middlewares:

```js
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In the middleware");
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In another middleware");
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

We don't see `In another middleware`. The reason for that, is that we have to call `next()` here to allow the request to travel on to the next middleware in line, for example:

```js
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In the middleware");
    next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("In another middleware");
});

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

In the end, `next()` function allows the request to continue to the next middleware in line.

## Working with Middleware

Instead of setting a header (`app.setHeader()`) and writing (`app.write()`), there is a new utility function we can use, `send()`; `send()` method allows us to send a response. For example:

```js
const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
  next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {});

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```

It works great. The `send()` method by default sets an HTML content type (i.e. it looks like `app.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html")`.

## Behind the Express.js

You can go to the express framework in: <https://github.com/expressjs/express>

In this link, you should go to the `lib` folder, then `response.js` file. Then you should find the `send()` method; it should be in line `107` in `response.js` file.

This is all about the `send()` method.

The amazing feature is that the express and `app` object, sets up the server for us behind the scenes. It means that we only need to write:

```js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
  next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {});

app.listen(3000);
```

You can also go to the express framework in <https://github.com/expressjs/express>. In this link, you should go to the `lib` folder, then `application.js` file. Then you should find the `listen()` method; it should be in near line `616` in `application.js` file.

It's in the end:

```js
app.listen = function listen() {
  var server = http.createServer(this);
  return server.listen.apply(server, arguments);
};
```

## Handling Different Routes

We can add a path for our response with `app.use()`. We can set path in the first argument:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Some product</h1>");
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Note1**: The `"/"` not means the root or main path, it's a start of path. Every route starts with just a `/` slash.

**Note2**: **JavaScript** executes code from top to buttom, be careful.

## Parsing Incoming Requests

Let's make a simple form:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
  <form action="/product" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="title">
    <button type="submit">Add product</button>
  </form>
  `);
});

app.use("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // undefined
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Let's look at the `console.log(req.body)` line. It returns `undefined`. We need to parse this value with the third-party package. We can use `body-parser` package for it. We can install this package with `npm install --save body-parser` command.

Then we import this package:

```js
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");
```

We can use it with this following code:

```js
app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

`urlencoded()` returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the **Content-Type** header matches the type option.

The `extended` option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when `false`) or the qs library (when `true`).

The final code will then:

```js
const express = require("express");
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({extended: false}));

app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
  <form action="/product" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="title">
    <button type="submit">Add product</button>
  </form>
  `);
});

app.use("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

As you can see, we choose the `Toy` in form input. It gives us a key-value pair that contains `{ title: 'Toy' }` which also makes extracting that value easier. We don't have to do it manualy as we do it before.

**Note**: As we mentioned before, the express framework is pluggable.

## GET and POST and Others

Instead of `app.use()`, we can work with `get`, `post` and so on. For example we want to send a `POST` request through that from we have on `/add-product`.

```js
const express = require("express");
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({extended: false}));

app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
  <form action="/product" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="title">
    <button type="submit">Add product</button>
  </form>
  `);
});

app.post("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Additionally we also have `delete`, `patch` and `put` methods which are other HTTP works which we'll use later in the course (we can't really use them from a normal HTML document).

## Using Express Routing (GET Method)

We want to split our routing code over multiple files, we want to export our logic in different files and import it into main (i.e. `app.js`) file. We could do this, we could create files where we export these functions.

But express.js actually gives us a pretty nice way of outsourcing routing into other files. Let's make a `routes` folder:

```powershell
mkdir routes
```

If you use GNU/Linux or MAC OS, you can use command above. For Windows users, just press `ctrl + shift + N` or mouse right click.

In this folder, we want to add two files name `admin.js` and `shop.js` which that the `admin.js` is for us and the `shop.js` is for users.

Now we put some code into `admin.js` file:

```js
app.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
  <form action="/product" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="title">
    <button type="submit">Add product</button>
  </form>
  `);
});

app.post("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

It doesn't enough for us, we can use express router to export our code into our main file (`app.js`) with `express.Router()`:

```js
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
    <form action="/product" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="title">
      <button type="submit">Add product</button>
    </form>
    `);
});

router.post("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Note**: We want to use `GET` method in our `add-product` page.

As you can see, it's excatly like `app`. The advantages of using this is we can easily import it with:

```js
const express = require("express");
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

const adminRouter = require("./routes/admin");

app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(adminRouter);

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We export our `admin.js` script into main file and we just use it like `app.use(adminRouter);`.

**Warning**: Don't use it like `app.use(adminRouter());` or anything like that.

Then we repeat this task once again for main root (i.e. `/` path), it means that we want to move our code into `shop.js`:

```js
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

module.exports = router;
```

THen we import it into main file (i.e. `app.js`):

```js
const express = require("express");
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

const adminRouter = require("./routes/admin");
const shopRouter = require("./routes/shop");

app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(adminRouter);
app.use(shopRouter);

app.listen(3000);
```

The final result is:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const parsedBody = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

const adminRouter = require("./routes/admin");
const shopRouter = require("./routes/shop");

app.use(parsedBody.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(adminRouter);
app.use(shopRouter);

app.listen(3000);
```

```js
// admin.js - in `routes` folder
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.use("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`
    <form action="/product" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="title">
      <button type="submit">Add product</button>
    </form>
    `);
});

router.post("/product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});

module.exports = router;
```

```js
// shop.js - in `routes` folder
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello there</h1>");
});

module.exports = router;
```

Let's try these file by your own.

## Adding a 404 Error Page

We can add a `404` error code with writing `status()` after the response object, for example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send("<h1>Page not Found</h1>");
});
```

## Add a Dynamic HTML Content (Serving HTML Pages)

Consider this code:

```js
const filesystem = require("fs");

filesystem.readFile("message.txt", "UTF-8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});

node app.js
"Hello there"
```

We don't want to use this way. Instead, we can use a better and awesome way, express provides a method in the response object of the router called `sendFile()` that can be used to serve static files.

```js
// shop.js file
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile("views/shop.html");
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Warning1**: It would be failed, if someone uses GNU/Linux or MAC OS, the path will be changed.

**Warning2**: Accessing to **Node.js** files is prohibited (denied) for the end users. They can't go to the for example `views/shop.html` path.

In order to construct the path to this directory (i.e. `"views/shop.html"`), we can use a feature provided by **Node.js**; another core module. We can import the `path` core module:

```js
const path = require("path");
```

And then in `sendFile()` method, we send a file where we create a path with the help of this module by calling the `join()` method. `join()` method yields us a path at the end, it returns a path; but it constructs this path by concatenating the different segments.

Now the **first** segment we should pass here, is a global variable made available by **Node.js**; and that is the `__dirname`. This is a global variable which holds the absolute path on our operation system (i.e. OS) to this project folder; and now we can add a `,` comma and add `"views"` here. This is a **second** segment. Because the first segment is the path to this whole project folder. The **third** segment is that we want to go into the `views` folder and then the **third** segment will be our file(e.g. `"shop.html"`).

```js
// shop.js html
const path = require("path");
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "..", "views", "shop.html"));
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Warning**: We don't add slashes (i.e. `/` or `\`) here, because we use `path.join()`; not because of the abolute path, we could build this with `__dirname` and then concatenating this manually too. But we're using `path.join()` becuase this will automatically build the path in a way that we works on both Linux systems and Windows systems. Because as you might know, on Linux systems you have paths like `/user/products` but on Windows systems, you use `\` for your paths like `\user\products`. Therefore if you manually construct this with `/` or `\`, it would not run on Windows and the way around.

`path.join()` detects the operating system we've running on and then automatically builds a correct path.

Let's analyze the `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "..", "views", "shop.html"));`:

- `__dirname`: The absolute path
- `..`: Going to previous path
- `views`: The `views` folder
- `shop.html`: The `shop.html` HTML content

**Note**: We can also use `../` instead of `..`, but `..` is better and cleaner for us.

Now we can go to `localhost:3000/add-product` and see our changes.

The alternative way of choosing path, is that we can use `path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename)` in another file and export it into our `admin.js` and `shop.js` files. For example:

```js
// util.js
const path = require("path");
module.exports = path.dirname(require.main.filename);
```

**Note**: We used another one, because `process.mainModule.filename` is deprecated.

and the `main.js` file will be:

```js
const path = require("path");
const rootDir = require("../util");
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();

// GET
router.get("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(rootDir, "views", "add-product.html"));
});

// POST
router.post("/add-product", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body); // e.g. { title: 'Toy' }
  res.redirect("/");
});

module.exports = router;
```

In fact, the `path.dirname(require.main.filename)` is the main root of our project, not the absolute (current) path. With that, we can remove the `..` or `../` from the `res.sendFile()`.

## Serving Files Statically

As we mentioned before, accessing to **Node.js** files is prohibited (denied) for the end users. Now, how can we access `CSS` files in our HTML content?

We can use a good method that is provided by express framework, `express.static()`. We can use it in middlewares for example:

```js
// we adding extra middleware in our app.js file
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));
```

We expected that we want to add a `public` folder and then create our CSS file into that folder.

In the end, this is a built-in middleware function in express. It serves static files and is based on serve-static.

**Note1**: Make sure you don't set a wrong path for CSS files in your HTML content (maybe parent (folder) just need for that).

**Note2**: When we link to the stylesheet in the template, we don’t link to `/public/style.css` it is just `style.css`; because Express is already looking in the `public` folder, where we told it to with `app.use()`.

## Summary

**What is Express.js**?

- Express.js is **Node.js** framework - a package that adds a bunch of utility functions and tools and a clear set of rules on how the app should be build (middleware).
- It's highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it (middleware).

**Middleware, `next()` and Others**:

- Express.js relies heavily on middleware functions - we can easily add them by calling `use()`.
- Middleware functions handle request and should call `next()` to forward the request to the next function in line (from top to buttom) or send a response.

**Routing**:

- We can filter requests by path and method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc).
- If we filter by method, paths are matched exactly, otherwise, the first segment of a URL is matched.
- We can use the `express.Router()` to split our code across files elegantely.

**Serve Files**:

- We're not limited to serving dummy text as a response.
- We can `sendFile()`s to our users (e.g. HTML contents).
- If a request is directly made for a file (e.g. a `.css` file is requested), we can enable static serving for such files via `express.static()`.
