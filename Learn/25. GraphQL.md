# GraphQL

In this file, you will learn about: GraphQL

It looks like REST API which is stateless, client-independent API for exchanging the data. But now with **higher query flexibility**.

## What is GraphQL

We have our client, we send a request to `POST /graphql` endpoint on our server. Then we setup our definitions for **queries**, **mutations** and **subscriptions**. In these definitions, we use **type definitions**, because GraphQL uses a typed query language which means we define the types of data we work with, the types of data we return in a query and so on; in the end, these definitions are connected to so-called **Resolvers** which are functions that contain our server-side logic.

**Note**: If we compare that with REST API, the definitions would be our **routes** and the resolvers would be our **controllers**.

## How does GraphQL Work

- It's a normal Node (+Express) server
- One single endpoint (typically `/graphql`)
- Uses `POST` because request body defines data structure of retrieved data
- Server-side Resolver analyses request body, fetches a prepares and returns data.

**Note**: We use `POST` here to getting (fetching) data.

## Getting Started

First of all, we need install two packages in our project which are called `graphql` and `express-graphql`.

`graphql` will required for defining the schema of our GraphQL service (definition of the queries, mutations and so on). `express-graphql` to install a simple server that will do the parsing of incoming requests and so on. So let's install them:

```bash
npm install --save graphql express-graphql
```

Then we create a new folder which called `graphql`. Then we add two files here, `schema.js` and `resolver.js`. In `schema.js`, we define the queries, mutations and type we work with in our GraphQL service. In `resolver.js`, we will define the logic that is executed for incoming queries.

To create a schema, we need to import `buildSchema` function in our `schema.js` file:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");
```

This function allows us to build a schema which be parsed by `graphql` and by `express-graphql`. Then we export this schema in a different way:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = buildSchema(``);
```

To define a graphql schema, in this string, we type `schema` and add `{}` curly braces here:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = buildSchema(`
    schema {

    }
`);
```

**Warning**: There is no `:` colon after `schema`.

In that schema, we define a `query` field (like property), and this will be an object with all the queries and queries are the parts where we get data.

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = buildSchema(`
    schema {
        query:
    }
`);
```

To make that easier to read, we'll add a saparate type for that with the `type` keyword. We can choose any name for that `type`, for example:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = buildSchema(`
    type RootQuery {

    }

    schema {
        query:
    }
`);
```

Then we add a query here, for example we add `hello` as a query:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = buildSchema(`
    type RootQuery {
        hello: String
    }

    schema {
        query:
    }
`);
```

We add a colon after the query name and then we set a type for that query (i.e. `String`). GraphQL knows a couple of types, `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `ID` and so on.

Thereafter, we set `RootQuery` for `query` field:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

module.exports = buildSchema(`
    type RootQuery {
        hello: String
    }

    schema {
        query: RootQuery
    }
`);
```

Now our schema is ready. We can send `hello` query to get back some text. Now that some text is defined in the resolver. So we work in the `resolver.js` file:

```js
// resolver.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = {
    hello() {

    }
}
```

We need a method for every query or mutation we define in our schema and **the name has to match of course**.

**Note**: We don't need a resolver for `query`, because in our schema, we setup our `RootQuery` which is made up of these sub-queries (e.g. `hello`) which need resolvers.

Now we want to print `Hello Persian Sight` here:

```js
// resolver.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = {
  hello() {
    return "Hello Persian Sight";
  }
};
```

Now we need to expose it to the public and that can be done with the `express-graphql` package. So we import this package to our `app.js` file:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql"); // <-- this line

const app = express();

app.use("/graphql", ...);

app.listen(8080);
```

Then we use the `graphqlHttp()` method which is provided by `express-graphql` package, and we pass a **JavaScript** object to it to configure it. This needs two items to work. The **first** is the `schema`; the **second** is the `resolver`:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const schema = require("./graphql/schema");
const resolver = require("./graphql/resolvers");

const app = express();

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: resolver
  })
);

app.listen(8080);
```

## Postman Application

Now we can see our data in here.

1. Setting method as `POST` and entering our URL (e.g. <http://localhost:8080/graphql>)
2. Going to `Body` tab and selecting the `raw` radio button (for data format)
3. Finally we select the data format. So we want to work with `JSON` data.

In the `Body`, we write our queries:

```json
{
    "query": "{hello}"
}
```

Now if we click on `Send` button (for sending a request), we will see the response here:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "hello": "Hello Persian Sight"
    }
}
```

In the `resolver.js`, we return all the data but then GraphQL on the server will filter out just the data that was requested by the client.

**Warning**: You can also use the different way of creating schemas and resolvers. We just show you a easiest and appropriate way.

## Adding Fields

We can also add fields in GraphQL schema, for example:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

module.exports = buildSchema(`
    type TestData {
        text: String!
        number: Int!
    }

    type RootQuery {
        hello: TestData!
    }

    schema {
        query: RootQuery
    }
`);
```

Then we return a complex data:

```js
// resolver.js - in `graphql` folder
module.exports = {
  hello() { // hello resolver
    return { text: "Hello Persian Sight", number: 12345 };
  }
};
```

Now we go to the postman application and write our GraphQl query expression. First we write our query name (i.e. `hello`) and then we can get our properties (or fields) with adding one more `{}` curly braces, for example:

```json
{
    "query": "{ hello { text number } }"
}
```

**Note**: We separating them with whitespaces.

Now if we click on `Send` button (for sending a request), we will see the response here:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "hello": {
            "text": "Hello Persian Sight",
            "number": 12345
        }
    }
}
```

**Note**: `!` means that the data must have that data type, for example, weed can't use string value in our `number` property (i.e. `hello`'s property).

## Graphical Environment

Instead of using postman application, we can also use our GraphQL on the browser. To do that, we need to add `graphiql` in the configuration:

```js
// app.js
app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema: schema,
    rootValue: resolver,
    graphiql: true
  })
);
```

If we now go to the <http://localhost:8080/graphql> address, we see the graphical environment of GraphQL.

We can see our queries and fields in `Docs` button in top-right.

Now we can easily send our data with:

```query
{
  hello {
    text
    number
  }
}
```

Now if we click on Play button (or ctrl + return), the response will shown (our data will be executed) immediately:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": {
      "text": "Hello Persian Sight",
      "number": 12345
    }
  }
}
```

## Defining a Mutation Schema

We just got data from the response. Now we want to add a query that allows us to save data. We want to use `mutation` query to save our data:

```js
// schema.js - in `graphql` folder
const { buildSchema } = require("graphql");

module.exports = buildSchema(`
    type Post {
        _id: ID!
        title: String!
        content: String!
        imageUrl: String!
        creator: User!
        createdAt: String!
        updatedAt: String!
    }

    type User {
        _id: ID!
        email: String!
        password: String
        name: String!
        status: String!
        posts: [Post!]!
    }

    input UserInputData {
        email: String
        name: String
        password: String
    }

    type RootQuery {
        hello: String
    }

    type RootMutation {
        createUser(userInput: UserInputData): User!
    }

    schema {
        query: RootQuery
        mutation: RootMutation
    }
`);

```

This is our schema here. Mutation means that we store data in the database.

**Note**: You should add `query` in `schema` here to shows all the queries in GraphiQL environment.

Now we work with resolver here:

```js
// resolver.js - in `graphql` folder
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

const User = require("../models/user");

module.exports = {
  createUser: async ({ userInput }, req) => {
    //   const email = args.userInput.email;
    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email: userInput.email });
    if (existingUser) {
      const error = new Error("User exists already!");
      throw error;
    }
    const hashedPw = await bcrypt.hash(userInput.password, 12);
    const user = new User({
      email: userInput.email,
      name: userInput.name,
      password: hashedPw
    });
    const createdUser = await user.save();
    return { ...createdUser._doc, _id: createdUser._id.toString() };
  }
};
```

Our User Model is:

```js
// user.js - in `models` folder
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const userSchema = new Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    default: 'I am new!'
  },
  posts: [
    {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Post'
    }
  ]
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

Then we send our data with:

```query
mutation {
  createUser(userInput: {email: "ultihamid@gmail.com", name: "Hamid", password: "test"}) {
    _id
    email
  }
}
```

Now we get a JSON that contains:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "_id": "6001a706d988f41600dc5007",
      "email": "ultihamid@gmail.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Now we executed our query. If we go to the our MongoDB database (or Compass), we see our user in there that contains:

```js
_id: 6001a7afd988f41600dc5008
status:"I am new!"
posts: Array
email: "ultihamid@gmail.com"
name: "Hamid"
password: "$2a$12$DcrUQQI5HzgZW40vJjDzQeWncAibs8ZoSH66YbAx.P557Ls5vfse6"
__v: 0
```

**Note**: You can also use `express-validator` to validate your input.

## Summary

**GraphQL Core Conccept**:

- Stateless, client-independent API for exchanging the data
- Higher flexibility than REST APIs offer due to custom query language that is exposed to the client.
- Queries (`GET`), Mutation (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) and Subscriptions can be used to exchange and manage data.
- **All** GraphQL requests are directed to **one** endpoint (`POST` requestss to `/graphql`).
- The server parses the incoming query expression (typically done by third-party packages) and calls the appropriate resolvers.
- GraphQL is **not** limited to React.js applications! We can use it with any front-end application; be that a mobile app, a single page app (SPA) with any framework or whatever we have.

**GraphQL vs REST**:

- REST APIs are great for static data requirements (e.g. file upload, scenarios where we need the same data all the time).
- GraphQL gives up higher flexibility by exposing a full query language to the client.
- Both REST and GraphQL APIs can be implemented with **any** framework and actually even with **any** server-side language.
