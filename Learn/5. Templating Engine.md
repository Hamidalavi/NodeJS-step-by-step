# Templating Engine

In this file, you will learn about:

- Managing Data (without a Database)
- Render Dynamic Content in our Views
- Understanding Templating Engines

## What is Templating Engines?

A **template engine** enables us to use static template files in our application. At runtime, the **template engine** replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Indeed, we can use template engines to inject our content and get HTML files out of them. Some templating engines:

- EJS
- Pug (Jade)
- Handlebars
- Mustache
- Dust

EJS looks something like `<p><%= name %></p>`, we write normal HTML markup and then the dynamic content we want to output (plain **JavaScript** in our templates).

Pug looks something like `p #{name}`, we use minimal HTML and custom template language.

Handlebars looks something like `<p>{{ name }}</p>`, we use normal HTML and custom template language.

We use first three of this list (EJS, Pug and Hndlebars) in this file.

We can install them by `npm install ejs pug express-handlebars --save` or `npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars` command.

## Working with Templating Engines

First of all, we need to go to the <https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.settings.table> link.

For example, we want to use `pug` template engine. For that, we can set a configuration with `app.set()` method. `app.set()` allows us to set any values globally on our express application. This method takes two arguments. Consider:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "pug");
app.set("views", "views");
```

Now we're telling express that we want to compile dynamic templates with the `pug` engine (first `app.set()`) and where to find these templates (second `app.set()`). In second `app.set()`, if we are using folder name, we need to change it, for example:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "pug");
app.set("views", "folderName");
```

Consider this `pug` file:

```pug
//- shop.pug - views folder
<!DOCTYPE html>
html(lang="en")
    head
        meta(charset="UTF-8")
        meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
        meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="ie=edge")
        title My Shop
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css")
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/product.css")
    body
        header.main-header
            nav.main-header__nav
                ul.main-header__item-list
                    li.main-header__item
                        a.active(href="/") Shop
                    li.main-header__item
                        a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
```

We added this file into our `views` folder. In our `shop.js` file, instead of using:

```js
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(rootDir, 'views', 'shop.html'));
  console.log(adminData.products);
});
```

we can use:

```js
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("shop");
});
```

`res.render()` method is provided by express.js and it will use the default templating engine. We also don't have to construct a path to that folder, instead we can just say `"shop"`. We also don't need `"shop.pug"`, because we defined `"pug"` as a default templating engine; so it will looks for `.pug` files.

Now that works great.

## Outputting Dynamic Content

The `.render()` method also takes second argument which is a object:

```js
// shop.js file
router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("shop", { docTitle: "Shop" });
});
```

**Q**: How can we use that?

**Answer**: As we mentioned above, we can use them in psudo HTML content (`.pug` file) and use `p #{name}` syntax:

```pug
<!DOCTYPE html>
html(lang="en")
    head
        meta(charset="UTF-8")
        meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
        meta(http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible", content="ie=edge")
        title #{docTitle}
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/main.css")
        link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/product.css")
    body
        header.main-header
            nav.main-header__nav
                ul.main-header__item-list
                    li.main-header__item
                        a.active(href="/") Shop
                    li.main-header__item
                        a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product
```

Now our website title will change automatically (we have a dynamic value here).

Difference between `pug` and real HTML content:

- `<h1 class="my-class"></h1>` => `h1.my-class`
- `<div class="container"></div>` => `.container`
- `<a href="/admin/add-product">Add Product</a>` => `a(href="/admin/add-product") Add Product`
- -`<a href="/path" id="my-id"></a>` => `a(href="/path")#my-id`
- In `pug` files, we have to indent content like Python language.
- In `pug` files, we don't need to close the tag.

Check out pug official docs: <https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html>

We don't want to continue with `pug`, sorry about that.

## Working with Handlebars Engine

We can work with this engine by importing the engine into our project:

```js
const expressHbs = require("express-handlebars");
```

We can use this with `app.engine()` method and we pass the `expressHbs` into it:

```js
const express = require("express");
const expressHbs = require("express-handlebars");

const app = express();

app.engine("handlebars", expressHbs);
```

First argument if for the engine name and second argument is for our imported engine.

So that object we just imported, that just turns out to be a function; we can call and we have to call that initialises this engine:

```js
const express = require("express");
const expressHbs = require("express-handlebars");

const app = express();

app.engine("handlebars", expressHbs());
```

Now we can edit the configuration:

```js
const express = require("express");
const expressHbs = require("express-handlebars");

const app = express();

app.engine("handlebars", expressHbs());
app.set("view engine", "handlebars");
app.set("views", "views");
```

Now we're ready to use `handlebars` in our code.

**Note**: We can also change the engine name (i.e. `handlebars` to `hbs`) and then we can add a file with `.hbs` extension. Before that, we must wrote: `test.handlebars` and now we can write: `test.hbs`.

To working with `handlebars` files, we have to create an HTML content (with `.handlebars` or `.hbs` (or whatever we want) extension). Then as we said before, we use `{{ }}` for outputting dynamic content with `handlebars` engine. For example:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{{ dynamicTitle }}</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>{{ dynamicContent }}</h1>
    <p>{{ myParagraph }}</p>
</body>

</html>
```

Continue with <https://handlebarsjs.com/>, we don't continue again. Because we want stick with `ejs`.

## Working With EJS Engine (Rendering Server-side HTML with Templates)

We want to work in scratch, because we want you understand this template engine by 100%.

We can render server-side HTML with `ejs` package. The **first** step is to install this package with `npm install --save ejs` command.

```powershell
npm install --save ejs
```

The **second** step is for creating a new file to store our HTML files we want to send back. Though we'll not actually create a HTML file in there, but instead a **template** which contains HTML content; but where we can also inject dynamic content. So we can have a mixture of HTML static content and dynamic content. This will be all then merged together into HTML file on the server-side and sent back to the client.

So on the client we will receive an HTML file but it allows us to enrich this HTML file with dynamic content. For that, we need the `ejs` package, a library that allows us to define such a template which then parses the template file and finds a special syntax in there which we can use to output dynamic content and that makes working with such a template easier.

We need to tell express.js, which supports such templating engine as they are called. We want to use this templating engine; and we do tell express.js is if we want to do that, by calling the `set()` method on the `app` object which allows us to set up some global options and there we want to set the `view engine` option (with a whitespace between the two words) to `ejs` ...:

```js
const app = express();
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```

which tells express that the engine for parsing our views (our template) should be `ejs` (the package we just installed) and then we also tell express.js where it finds our views; and for that, we add a `views` setting and point at the folder that holds our view files. Our case, that's `views` but if named that folder differently, you would have to change it here:

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views"); // second argument => folder name
...
```

Now with that, we can add such a template in the `views` folder and we'll add an `index.ejs` file. This means that `ejs`, this package we just installed will be able to detect this file and parse it.

In this file, we generally just write HTML code as we're used to it but we can add a special syntax which the `ejs` package understands to inject dynamic content. Let's make a HTML content in `index.ejs` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Node Demo</title>
</head>

<body>
    <form action="/" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username">
        <button type="submit">Send!</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We just want to use one of the most basic features with an `<%= %>` and now between that, we can refer to any variable name which we plan on providing to this view and we'll come back to how we provide that in a second.

So here (in `index.ejs` file) we'll point at `user`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Node Demo</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello <%= user %></h1>
    <form action="/" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username">
        <button type="submit">Send!</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

We'll take `user` here and now we have this special syntax in here. This is of course not regular HTML; but instead, this is simply a syntax understood by the `ejs` package when it later parses this file.

Now to tell `ejc` to parse this file, we need to make sure that we don't set back a response like `response.send("<h1>Hello xxx</h1>)`. But instead here, we want to render a view as a response; and for that, the `response` object has a `render()` method, also added by express.js (i.e. this does not exist in pure **Node.js**).

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
  response.render();
});

app.listen(3000);
```

The `render()` method takes a couple of arguments and the **first** argument is the name of the **view** we want to render. In our case, that's `index`, because we have the `index.ejs` file in the views folder. We don't need to specify the path, because we set the `views` folder to be the folder that holds our views up there. So now here, `index` also no extensions required, because we told express that we use `ejs` and that will automatically look for a `.ejs` extension.

We can continue with the **second** argument and that would be an object full of properties or full of data we want to provide to this template; and here we should provide a `user` property, because that will be the data `ejs` then can use when it parses this template.

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
  next();
});

app.use((request, response, next) => {
  const userName = request.body.username || "KNOWN USERNAME";
  response.render("index", { user: userName });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We should render this file (i.e. `index.ejs`) and have our dynamic content in there. And that's it. All things work correctly.

**Important**: If you inspect this in the browser, you get a normal HTML content which is rendered here. Also in the response (**Network** tab => Response in developer tools), if you have a look that in the **Response** tab, you'll see you get a normal HTML content. We have no dynamic part here, because this dynamic segment is filled on the server. On the server we generate a HTML document which is then appended to the outgoing response. **That's what the `view engine` does here**.

## Simple EJS for JSON Data

```js
// without HTML file
let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});

// without HTML file
let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('index', {people: people});
```

More information: <https://ejs.co/>

## EJS Syntaxes

- `<% %>`: For conditions or loop through the HTML content.
- `<%= %>`: We would render some variable that holds a string that holds HTML code; it wouldn't render that HTML code but render it as text to avoid cross-site scripting attacks.
- `<%= %>`: With a `-` minus we can avoid this and really render the HTML code.

## Working on the Layout with Partials

We can do this combined with a keyword offered by `ejs`, the `include()` keyword; which allows us to include a certain element into this page.

Now here in `include()`, we add a string which is holds the path to the file we want to include:

```js
<%- include("include/head.ejs") %>

</head>

<body>
    <main>
        <form action="">
            <input type="text">
            <input type="text">
        </form>
    </main>
</body>

</html>
```

The HTML header is now in the `includes/head.ejs` path. This is exactly looks like PHP language with `include()` keyword.

If you don't understand yet, let me bring you some youtube videos. Let's import all files which in the separate files:

```js
<%- include("include/head.ejs") %>

</head>

<body>
    <%- include("includes/navigation.ejs") %>

<%- include("includes/end.ejs") %>
```

Now we imported all content into this file.

But, we think it's very hard around your head. We recommend you to practice alot. In this case, we bring a simple app and working with `ejs` again. Are you ready?

## Time to Practice

First of all, we need to ready for first initialization with `npm init`, then we have to install these packages:

- express.js: `npm install --save express`
- ejs: `npm install --save ejs`
- body-parser: `npm install --save body-parser`
- nodemon: `npm install --save-dev nodemon`

This is our main `app.js` file:

```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

// app.use(bodyParser({extended: false})); // deprecated
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render();
});

app.get("/users", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render();
});

app.post("/add-user", (req, res, next) => {
  res.redirect("/users");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Other options are in `5.1. ejs-practice` folder.
