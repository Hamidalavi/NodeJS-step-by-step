# Async Requests

What is request in real word? The **request** was always a request sent from our browser when we submitted a form or entered a URL or clicked a link. Typically we send a request from our client to server and we get back a response.

What is response in real word? **Response** always was either a redirect (redirect to another route that returned a HTML page) or a HTML page.

There are tasks where we don't want to reload the page just to delete an item. For (in) modern application, we never need to fetch a new HTML page but we constantly change the existing page. This is faster than loading a new one. We'll cover it later in next file.

For asynchronous requests, we send the request, but that request contains just some data in a special format named JSON, and that data is sent to the server (to a certain URL or a route); and then we return a response and that response is also returned behind the scenes. So it's not a new HTML page that needs to be rendered; it's instead just some data in JSON format.

That is how client_server can communicate through **JavaScript** without reloading or rebuilding the page (without exchanging a new HTML page).
