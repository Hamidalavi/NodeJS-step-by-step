# File Uploads & Downloads

In this file, you will learn about: File Uploads & Downloads

- Using `multer` package
- Uploading Files
- Filtering Files
- Downloading Files
- Working with PDF
- Deleting Files

Before, we add some URLs to allow the users to show the images or videos, templates and so on. We right now always have to enter a URL; that's not a very realistic setup. Because in a real world application, our users who are trying to sell things will probably not have pictures of their products stored somewhere in the web.

We want to give our users the possibility of uploading images. Adding file upload means that we have to do two things; the **first** thing is that we need to adjust our from to show a file picker to our users; the **second** part is that we need to able to accept that file in the place where we handle it (where we handle the incoming requests).

So we want add a file picker in the front-end (from `.ejs` file):

```html
<!-- file.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="POST">
        <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Upload"
  });
});

app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const image = req.body.image;
  console.log(image);
  res.send("Hi");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

It looks good, but there is minor problem. We setup a middleware in `app.js`, we're using a special middleware, the `bodyParser` middleware. This middleware uses or exposes a couple of different parsers and we're using the `urlencoded` parser.

`urlencoded` data is text data. So if the form is submitted without a file, so just with text fields, no matter if that text filed then stores a number. a URL or plain text; but it's all encoded in text when it is submitted. This format is called **URL encoded**.

How can we know that format? We can see our formatted text in **Network** tab in developer tools. So in our case, it's **Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded**. This means it tries to put all the data as text into its from body.

If you go to the **Form Data** section, you'll see the `image:` with no value (or some value if you pick a one file).

**Note**: Search it in Request Headers.

The `bodyParser` that we're using here, does not give us any parser that could handle file data as well; we need a new package for that. It's called `multer`. We can install this package with `npm install --save multer` command.

`multer` is another third-party package that parses incoming requests; but this package parses incoming requests for files. It's able to handle file requests as well or request with mixed data (i.e. with text and file data).

We don't have to remove the `bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })`, because we still need that form signup form, sign in form and so on.

Let's add another field in our form which is `enctype` which we'll set to `multipart/form-data`.

```html
<!-- file.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

**Note**: The default value is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for `enctype` attribute or field.

The `multer` package will looking for incoming requests with `multipart/form-data` type of data and will be able to parse both the text and our file (binary data).

## Use `multer` on Back-end

To initialize the `multer` package, we need to import it to our project:

```js
// app.js
const multer = require("multer");
```

Then we use it with:

```js
// app.js
app.use(multer().single("image"));
```

`multer` has to be executed as a function and then we have to call another method on that; and that defines if we expect to get multiple files or only single files (we will only expect one file). Then we define the input name which will hold the file (i.e. `image`).

**Warning**: `.single("image")` is not a random value, this is a input name.

Instead of using `req.body.image`, we need to change it to `req.file`. For example:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const multer = require("multer");

const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(multer().single("image"));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Upload"
  });
});

app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const image = req.file;
  console.log(image);
  res.send("Hi");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Now if we run this code and then pick a file from our computer, the output will be:

```powershell
{
  fieldname: 'image',
  originalname: 'JavaScript_Cert.png',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  buffer: <Buffer 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52 00 00 09 f6 00 00 0d b3 08 06 00 00 00 a0 1d be 52 00 00 20 00 49 44 41 54 78 9c ec bd 07 78 94 d7 b5 ... 2919343 more bytes>,
  size: 2919393
}
```

Now the format of data is **Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryg2N1PG8JGjrB9TBG**

`buffer`: It is essentially how Node handles the binary data. In the end, `<Buffer 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52 00 00 09 f6 00 00 0d b3 08 06 00 00 00 a0 1d be 52 00 00 20 00 49 44 41 54 78 9c ec bd 07 78 94 d7 b5 ... 2919343 more bytes>` is the result of the streamed data.

We can pass some option into `multer()` function. Consider:

```js
// app.js
app.use(multer({ dest: "images" }).single("image"));
```

`dest` is the destination directory or folder for uploaded files.

Now if we re-run our Node app, we will see:

```powershell
{
  fieldname: 'image',
  originalname: 'JavaScript_Cert.png',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  destination: 'images',
  filename: 'f294299ddaa94c63ba2d3665ff65b693',
  path: 'images\\f294299ddaa94c63ba2d3665ff65b693',
  size: 2919393
}
```

We don't have `buffer`, because now `multer` is able to do something with the buffer; instead of just buffering it all in memory, it can turns that buffer back into binary data and it stores it in `path` here.

**Important**: Path is different in other OSs.

If we have a look at our folder, we should now have an `images` folder with some file(s) in there. Now that (those) file(s) has some random hash name, does not have a file extension and it is not recognized as an image; but indeed, if we change that name and we add `.png` at the end, we see the image that we uploaded.

## Working with Storage - Uploading Files

What is `storage` and how can we use it?

If `storage` is not set and `dest` is, `multer` will create a `DiskStorage` instance configured to store files at `dest` with random filenames. `dest` is ignored if `storage` is set.

Now we want to setup storge here:

```js
// app.js
const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination:,
  filename:
})
```

`destination` and `filename` keys are two functions which `multer` will call for an incoming file. These functions control how that file is handled regarding the place where we store it, and regarding the naming.

We can confing the `destination` function:

```js
// app.js
const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, "images");
  },
  filename...
});
```

The `destination` function takes three arguments, **first** is for request, **second** is for file and **third** one is for callback function which takes two arguments.

In the **first** argument, that would be an error message we throw to inform `multer` that something is wrong with the incoming file (and it should not store it); but if that is `null`, we tell `multer` that it's OK to store it. We can store it in the `images` folder (which is in the **second** argument).

Now let's work on `filename` function:

```js
// app.js
const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination...,
  filename: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, file.originalname);
  }
});
```

The `filename` also takes three arguments like `destination` function. But the second argument is the file name. We can pass any string to it, but we want name it to original name; so we do it with `file.originalname`.

After the `fileStorage` setup, we need to change the `multer` option to `storge` instead of `dest`:

```js
// app.js
app.use(multer({ storage: fileStorage }).single("image"));
```

The full code is:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const multer = require("multer");

const app = express();

const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, "images");
  },
  filename: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, file.originalname);
  }
});

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(multer({ storage: fileStorage }).single("image"));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Upload"
  });
});

app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const image = req.file;
  console.log(image);
  res.send("Hi");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Note1**: If you remove the `images` folder, it would throw an error with `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'path\filename.extension'` message.

**Note2**: Look at the path above, it's for Windows OS.

Now we're done with uploading image.

**Warning**: If there is same file name here, the last file will override the old one.

## Filtering Files

We can filter our files with `fileFilter` option in `multer`:

```js
// app.js
app.use(multer({ storage: fileStorage, fileFilter: /* in here*/ }).single("image"));
```

Now we configured the `fileFilter`:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const multer = require("multer");

const app = express();

const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, "images");
  },
  filename: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, file.originalname);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req, file, callback) => {
  if (
    file.mimetype === "image/png" ||
    file.mimetype === "image/jpg" ||
    file.mimetype === "image/jpeg"
  ) {
    callback(null, true);
  } else {
    callback(null, false);
  }
};

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(multer({ storage: fileStorage, fileFilter: fileFilter }).single("image"));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Upload"
  });
});

app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const image = req.file;
  console.log(image);
  res.send("Hi");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

We can also use concise method here, for example:

```js
// app.js
app.use(multer({ storage: fileStorage, fileFilter }).single("image"));
```

We said, if the `callback(null, true);`, the user can upload the image with the specific extension (mimetype)(`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`).

**Note**: If you want to store data in your database, you can get the file's path with `req.file.path`.

## Downloading Files

First of all, consider these files:

```html
<!-- file.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>
        <%= pageTitle %>
    </title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="title">
        <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
        <input type="number" name="price" placeholder="price">
        <input type="text" name="description" placeholder="description">
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
    <form action="/show-product" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title">
        <button type="submit">Show</button>
    </form>
</body>

</html>
```

```js
// product.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const multer = require("multer");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoDBStore = require("connect-mongodb-session")(session);
const Product = require("./product");

const app = express();
const URI =
  "mongodb+srv://hamid:1yN49snBKxXgzued@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
const store = new MongoDBStore({
  uri: URI,
  collection: "sessions"
});

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "my secret",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: store
  })
);

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });

const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, "images");
  },
  filename: (req, file, callback) => {
    callback(null, file.originalname);
  }
});

const fileFilter = (req, file, callback) => {
  if (
    file.mimetype === "image/png" ||
    file.mimetype === "image/jpg" ||
    file.mimetype === "image/jpeg"
  ) {
    callback(null, true);
  } else {
    callback(null, false);
  }
};

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(
  multer({ storage: fileStorage, fileFilter: fileFilter }).single("image")
);
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(express.static("images"));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Upload"
  });
});

app.post("/show-product", (req, res, next) => {
  const title = req.body.title;
  Product.find({ title })
    .then(found => {
      console.log(found);
      return res.redirect("/");
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
});

app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const title = req.body.title;
  const image = req.file;
  const price = req.body.price;
  const description = req.body.description;
  const product = new Product({
    title,
    imageUrl: image.path,
    price,
    description
  });

  product.save();
  console.log("Added");
  res.redirect("/");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

There are many ways of downloading files, but we work with one way, the **static serving**.

We can serving the folder statically. Statically serving a folder means that, requests to files in that folder will be handled automatically and then files will be returned. It means that, we tell express serve the files from inside that folder as if they were on the root folder. So we can add `images` folder here:

```js
// app.js
app.use(express.static("images"));
```

Then we get the image URL from images with:

```js
// app.js
app.post("/upload", (req, res, next) => {
  const title = req.body.title;
  const image = req.file;
  const price = req.body.price;
  const description = req.body.description;
  const product = new Product({
    title,
    imageUrl: image.path,
    price,
    description
  });

  product.save();
  console.log("Added");
  res.render("file", {
    pageTitle: "File Download",
    product
  });
});
```

We just add `product` in the `render()` method, to use that URL, we need to add it into our View file:

```html
<!-- file.ejs -->
<form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="title">
    <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
    <input type="number" name="price" placeholder="price">
    <input type="text" name="description" placeholder="description">
    <img width="100" height="100" src="<%= product.imageUrl %>" alt="">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

We set `product.imageUrl` in image source. But the image still not loaded, what happens here?

To fix this problem, we need to add exact path here, to that, we need to add `images` in middleware.

```js
// app.js
app.use("/images", express.static("images"));
```

**Note**: You can add `path` here if you working on other OSs:

```js
// app.js
const path = require("path");
app.use("/images", express.static(path.join(__dirname, "images"));
```

Now everything is good.

## Working with PDF

To work with PDFs we need to install a package which is called `pdfkit`:

```powershell
npm install --save pdfkit
```

**Note**: behind the scenes, the `core-js` is installed automatically.

Thereafter, we import this package to our project:

```js
// app.js
const PDFDocument = require("pdfkit");
```

This package exposes the PDF document constructor. So let's create a PDF document here with creating a new `PDFDocument` constructor.

```js
// app.js
const PDFDoc = new PDFDocument();
```

Then we pipe this output into a writable file stream, to do that, we need to (creating a PDF file):

```js
// app.js
PDFDoc.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, "images", "test.pdf")));
```

We also need to pipe the output into our response if we use `express` framework (in middleware):

```js
// app.js - in get or post
PDFDoc.pipe(res);
```

The `res` (response) is a writable read stream, `PDFDoc` is a readable one, so we can do that.

That's it, we can easily make a PDF with this package. We can also add more options to `PDFDoc`:

For images:

```js
// app.js
PDFDoc.image(path.join(__dirname, "images", "JavaScript_Cert.png"), {
  fit: [250, 300],
  align: "center",
  valign: "center"
});
```

To add another page:

```js
// app.js
PDFDoc.addPage().fontSize(25).text("Next page...", 100, 100);
```

`100`, `100` are the X and Y position. We can modify the position of text by passing X and Y coordinates to the text method after the text itself.

Draw a green triangle:

```js
// app.js
PDFDoc.save().moveTo(100, 150).lineTo(100, 250).lineTo(200, 250).fill("green");
```

Set underline to text:

```js
// app.js
PDFDoc.text("Hello world", { underline: true });
```

We don't want to focus on that, you can learn more with in <https://pdfkit.org/>.

Styling the text: <http://pdfkit.org/docs/text.html>

**Note**: You can make it dynamic with `express` framework with `res` (or vanilla **JavaScript**) and stream it both into a file and back to the client.

## Deleting Files

We can easily remove the file with `fs` module:

```js
// app.js
fs.unlink(path.join(__dirname, "images", "xxxx.png"), err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

**Note**: We can add some dynamic values and paths and they'll be deleted in our database too.
