# Deploying Our App

In this file, you will learn about: Deployment

We want to deploy our app both in the **server-side rendered views** (Vanilla HTML and Templating Engine (e.g EJS)) and **APIs** (REST and GraphQL.

So in both kinds of applications, we start a normal Node server and we use a Node framework (`express`). These types of applications have the same hosting requirements.

We dont have to make a difference here; because in the end, when we move our code to a web server, we just want to do the exact same thing we did locally.

Before we deploy our app on the sever, we need to be aware of something, for example:

- We can use **environment variables** to avoid hard-coded values in our code.
- We can use production API keys.
- We (you) should't add more error output details, hackers are everywhere.
- We must set secure response headers to avoid sending sensitive info to our users.
- We can add compression to reduce the response size.
- We can adding logs for noticing to updates and so on.
- We **must use** SSL/TLS to encrypt data in tanssit.

**Note**: The last three tips here, **compression, logging and SSL/TSL** are often handled by our hosting provier.

## Using Environment Variables

Consider this simple code:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const URI =
  "mongodb+srv://hamid:1yN49snBKxXgzued@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("test", { title: "Deploy" });
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(name);
  res.redirect("/");
});

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    app.listen(3000);
  });
```

In this example we didn't used the MVC pattern; in this code, we want to send it to our co-worker but he/she want to change the some part of code and use it for himself/herself.

If we want to send this code to more 100 persons, it's very hard to maually change the URL, PORT (or send to host providers) and etc.

First of all, we need to turn this connection URL (URI) into a template literal:

```js
// app.js
const URI = `mongodb+srv://hamid:1yN49snBKxXgzued@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
```

We can access environment variables on the `process` object. This is an object not defined by us, but this is globally availabe in the node app (it's part of the Node core runtime).

Now on this `process` object, we have the very helpful `env` property and that is now an object with all the environment variables this Node `process` knows. So we can define some variables here:

```js
// app.js
const URI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_PASSWORD}@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
```

In the `app.listen(3000);`, we also set `process.env`. Because most host providers or all host providers that manage that for us, will automatically inject the `PORT` environment variable:

```js
// app.js
mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  });
```

Most of time we can rely on the `PORT` being set and for local development, we'll still fallback to `3000`; because there, it will not set.

## Reading Evironment Variables

We want to read these environment variables in our Node code. How can we do that?

well, we can read them with three ways:

**First**, we can add them into our `package.json` file, for example:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "nodejs-step-by-step",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node MONGO_USER=hamid MONGO_PASSWORD=1yN49snBKxXgzued MONGO_DATABASE=shop"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "ejs": "^3.1.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.11.12"
  }
}
```

We can run our app with `npm start`. But it's not working nowadays.

But there is a very nice way, that we can store our environment variables in `nodemon.json` file, for example:

```json
// nodemon.json
{
    "env": {
        "MONGO_USER": "hamid",
        "MONGO_PASSWORD": "1yN49snBKxXgzued",
        "MONGO_DATABASE": "shop"
    }
}
```

**Note**: You need to install the `nodemone` package. Then you can set `start` script to `nodemon` or `nodemon app.js`:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "nodejs-step-by-step",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Hamid Alavi",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "ejs": "^3.1.5",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.11.12"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  }
}
```

We said we can use both `nodemon` or `nodemon app.js`, because we added the `main` field. If we remove that from `package.json`, we don't get any result (just executing the undefined file and reload).

**Warning**: If you use a third-party package like `stripe`, you need to pass the real API key, **not** the test key.

## Setting Secure Response Headers

We can secure our production app with `helmet` package. We can intall it with `npm install --save helmet` command and import it to our project:

```js
// app.js
const helmet = require("helmet");
```

We can use it easily:

```js
// app.js
app.use(helmet());
```

It will automatically run on all incoming requests and therefore also have a chance of adjusting the response headers. So we have:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const URI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_PASSWORD}@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
const helmet = require("helmet");

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(helmet());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("test", { title: "Deploy" });
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(name);
  res.redirect("/");
});

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  });
```

Now if we go to the **Network** tab in the developer tools, we see that we have more response headers here. These headers can secure our application.

**Note**: You can learn more about `helmet` in this <https://helmetjs.github.io/> link.

## Compressing Assets

We can compress our **JavaScript** and CSS files with `compression` package. We can install this awesome package with `npm install --save compression` command. Then we import it to our project:

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const URI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_PASSWORD}@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
const helmet = require("helmet");
const compression = require("compression"); // <-- this line

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

app.use(helmet());
app.use(compression()); // <-- this line
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("test", { title: "Deploy" });
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(name);
  res.redirect("/");
});

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  });
```

In this project, it doesn't make sense, because we don't have any front-end code here (or styling files like CSS files). Indeed, those files that we serving to our users will be compressed.

**Note1**: Image files are not compressed here, because that actually makes it to longer to load them.

**Note2**: Most hosting providers have some support of compression built-in. So they will compress assets and we don't have to do it with our own middleware. If some hosting providers don't support compression, then we can import the `compression` package to our project and use it.

## Setting up Request Logging

We can know about the behind the scenes of our server and what going on **on our sever** with logging. We can set log requests and read them. To do that, we need to install a new package, that is `morgan` package. We can install this package with `npm install --save morgn` command. Then we import that to our project:

```js
// app.js
const morgan = require("morgan");
```

Then we use it with:

```js
// app.js
app.use(morgan());
```

But that is not enough, we must set format here (default is combined). So we can do:

```js
app.use(morgan("combined"));
```

Now if we run our application (via `npm start` or `node app.js`), we see some logs in our console:

```powershell
::1 - - [16/Jan/2021:18:58:29 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 - "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.141 Safari/537.36"
```

We can add this log to our project files with the help of built-in `fs` and `path` modules:

```js
// app.js
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const URI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_PASSWORD}@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
const helmet = require("helmet");
const compression = require("compression");
const morgan = require("morgan");

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(
  path.join(__dirname, "access.log"),
  { flags: "a" }
);

app.use(helmet());
app.use(compression());
app.use(morgan("combined", { stream: accessLogStream }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("test", { title: "Deploy" });
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(name);
  res.redirect("/");
});

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  });
```

We store logs into our `access.log` file.

**Note1**: Most hosting providers are logging our requests data and we don't have to do it with our own middleware.

**Note2**: The best tool for writing logs is `console.log()`.

**Note3**: You can learn more in this <https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/> link.

## SSL Server Theory

If we want to deploy our app on the server, we need to secure our application. For example, there is an attacker who's eavesdropping on our data which we're sending from the client to the server. It's very bad problem for credit card data and etc. We can protect our data with SSL/TLS encryption.

**Once such encryption is in place, eavesdropping is not possible anymore**; because while the data is unreadable as long as it is in transit and it will be decrypted on the server. To enable that encryption (and to be able to decrypt it), we work with a **public and private** key-pairs; both are known to the server.

That **public** key not something we have to protect. The **private** key will ever only be known by the server; because the **private key will important for decrypting the data** and the **public key will be used or encrypting**.

Now in SSL certificate, we bind that public key to the server identity. The identity is something like the domain, the admin email address, we set that data when we create a certificate.

That SSL certificate therefore connects a public key and a server and sends that to the client (the browser). So we use a certificate authority for that, though we can create our own SSL certificates too (you learn it in this file). But when we create our own keys, the browser does not trust us that the information in there is correct. When a user want to enter our website, the browser will say **hey, this page uses SSL, but doesn't seem to be secure. It seems want to steal your data, do you want to go to this page anyway?**

Hence in production, we would use a SSL certificate provided by a known certificate authority which the browser trusts and therefore we have a real secure and trusted protection.

We have that public key and that public key is received by the client through that certificate and now the client can encrypt the data which it sends to the server; and the server can decrypt the data with that private key.

**Imortant**: Only that private key can decrypt that data.

## Setting up a SSL Server

To setup a SSL connection on our server with our own certificate (just for testing), we need to create a certificate. We do it with a command named `openssl`. For old Windows users, they need to install the `openssl` in this <https://github.com/01org/QAT_Engine> or <https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries> links.

**Note**: For MAC and Linux operation, it also work in the old versions.

To set **server certification** and **server private key**, we need to use `openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert` command; it's very long, but it is useful. This will give us that private key and the public key packed up in a certificate.

Once we hit enter, we'll be asked a couple of questions here:

1. Country Name (Our case is IR)
2. State or Province Name Name (Our case is Mazandaran)
3. Locality Name (Our case is Sari)
4. Organization Name (Our case is Persian Sight)
5. Organizational Unit Name (Our case is Education)
6. Common Name (Our case is localhost)

**Note1**: Our own self-signed certificate will not be accepted by browsers anyways; for production we should not use that option.

**Note2**: We (you) must set Common Name to `localhost`, otherwise the certificate will not work. Because this has to be set to our domain. For example, if you want to deploy your app on the server, you should set it to `example.com`. If we set it to another value, this is not requested.

After we did all that, we'll see find two new files in our folder. `server.cert` which is the certificate and `server.key` which is the private key. The **private key** will always stay on our server, the **certificate** is what we send to the client in the end.

## Using Private Key

First of all, we need to import the `https` core module in our app:

```js
// app.js
const https = require("https");
```

Then we need to read a private key with:

```js
// app.js
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("server.key");
```

This will block code execution until the file is read. We also need to define a certification:

```js
// app.js
const certificate = fs.readFileSync("server.cert");
```

With these two files read in, we need to adjust our server creation here:

```js
// app.js
https.createServer().listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```

We just removed the `app` object and write `https.createServer()`, now this function takes two arguments; the **first** one configures the server and here we have to point it at our **private key** and the **certification**; the **second** argument will be our request handler (our `express` application), so need to write:

```js
// app.js
https.createServer({key: privateKey, cert: certificate}, app).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```

See the full code:

```js
// app.js
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");
const https = require("https");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const URI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.MONGO_USER}:${process.env.MONGO_PASSWORD}@testcluster.xdext.mongodb.net/${process.env.MONGO_DATABASE}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`;
const helmet = require("helmet");
const compression = require("compression");
const morgan = require("morgan");
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("server.key");
const certificate = fs.readFileSync("server.cert");

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "views");

const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(
  path.join(__dirname, "access.log"),
  { flags: "a" }
);

app.use(helmet());
app.use(compression());
app.use(morgan("combined", { stream: accessLogStream }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("test", { title: "Deploy" });
});

app.post("/", (req, res, next) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  console.log(name);
  res.redirect("/");
});

mongoose
  .connect(URI, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Connected");
    https.createServer({key: privateKey, cert: certificate}, app).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  });
```

Now we using SSL encryption and if we now go to `http://localhost:3000`, this will **fail**, because by default it uses HTTP. If we use `https://localhost:3000`, it also will **fail**; because the browser does not accept that custom or that self-signed certificate. But we can ignore the warning with `Advanced` button and then `Proceed to localhost (unsafe)` link.

We can go to this page, but it is just valid for one month.

## Hosting Providers

We want deploy our app on the server, so we need to a hosting provider here. So we want to work with `Heroku` here.

## Git Theory

Git is a version control system, it's a tool which we can use. We can **save and manage our source code** with Git. It allows us to work with so-called `commit`, `branche`, `remote repository`.

- Commits are **snapshots** of our code. We can always switch between commits. We usually create a commit after bug fixes or new features.

- Branches also allow us to not just have one history of snapshot, but multiple histories for different versions of our code.

- Remote repositories means that our code is not only stored locally as it is by default, but that we can store it and commit and branches in the cloud and it means that we can protect against loss of local data and we can also access our source code from different machines and share it with other developers. We can also use that feature to deploy our code automatically.

## Git Basics

- `git init`: Initialize a Git repository in the current folder.
- `git status`: Show the current status of our Git repository (the **working tree** status).
- `git add .`: Track changes of all files in our repository.
- `git commit -m "our message"`: Save updated code to a new Commit named **our message**.
- `git log`: List all Commits inside our Branch.
- `git checkout branch-name`: Jump to the last Commit of a Branch
git checkout commitid Jump to a specific Commit of a Branch (`commitid` should be the ID of the Commit we want to checkout).
- `git checkout -- .`: Jump back to the last Commit and remove any untracked changes.
- `get reset --hard`: Turn the selected Commit into the new HEAD.
- `git branch`: List all Branches inside our Repository.
- `git -b branch-name`: Create a new Branch named `branch-name`.
- `git merge branch-name`: Merge two Branches, `branch-name` is the Branch we merge with the Branch we’re currently working in.
- `git branch -D branch-name`: Delete the Branch named `branch-name`.

## Finally, Deploying Our App On Our Hosting Provider

Since we restricted by heroku (by sanction), we can't use it anymore.

1. If we deploy our app on the server, it automaticaly **turns to `https`** and we don't need to change the protocol type.

2. All files will be optimized automatically and we don't need to add `compression` package here.
