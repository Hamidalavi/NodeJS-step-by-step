## What is SQL

SQL database think so-called **tables**. We might have a `users`, a `product` or an `orders` tables.

![table](https://www.teach-ict.com/gcse_new/databases/terminology/miniweb/images/table.gif)

In each table, we have so-called **fileds** or **columns**. For example, a user could be defined by having an ID, an email, a name.

![fields](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/database-100311003251-phpapp01/95/database-17-728.jpg?cb=1268267618)

And a product could have an ID, title, price and a description.

Now we fill in data for these fields so-called **records** (the rows in our tables).

The final result is:

## Core SQL Database Characteristics

We have a strong data schema so that for each table. We clearly define how the data in there should look like, which fields do we have, which type of data does each field store; is it a number, is it string, is it a text, is it a boolean?

We also have relations between our data, this is another characteristic of SQL based databases. We relate our different tables with basically three important kinds of relations: **One-to-One, One-to-Many or Many-to-Many**. This means that we can have two tables where each record fits one other record; a record might fit multiple other records or multiple records in table A can fit multiple records in table B.

## What is Keywords and Parameters

SQL stands for **structured query language**. Queries are commands we use to interact with the database; e.g. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 23`.

In query above, we have got a couple of keywords there which are making up that SQL language, like `SELECT`, `FROM` or `WHERE`.

We also have query parameters or data like `*`, `users` or `age > 23`.

## What is NoSQL

In NoSQL, tables are called **collections**; but we can think of them as tables.

In a collection, we don't find records but so-called **documents**. Documents are very close to how we describe data in **JavaScript** (**JavaScript** object).

One other thing is, that in the NoSQL world, we got no real relations; instead we go for duplicate data.

## Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

In horizontal scaling, we add more servers and merge data into one database.

In vertical scaling, we make our existing server stronger by adding more CPU or memory or with something like that; specially with cloud providers, this is very easy. We choose another option from the dropdown, we pay more and we're done. The problem is that we have some limit; we can't fit infinitely much CPU power into a single machine.

## SQL vs NoSQL

**SQL**:

- Data uses schemas
- SQL have relations
- Data is distributed across multiple tables'
- Horizontal scaling is difficult / impossible; vertical scaling is possible
- Limitations for lots of (thousands) read and write queries per second

**NoSQL**:

- Schema-less
- No (or very few) relations
- Data is merged / nested in a few collections
- Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
- Great performance for mass read and write requests

## Advantages of Both

**SQL**:

- Clearly defined schema, data integrity is ensured
- Relations allow us to store each data only once - no duplicates

**NoSQL**:

- Absence of a schema gives us more flexibility - we can adjust our stored data at any point and introduce new **fields**
- Data is stored in the format our app needs it - this speeds up fetching the data
- Vertical and horizontal scaling is possible, hence our database will be able to handle any amount of read / write requests our app throws at it

## Disadvantages of Both

**SQL**:

- Less flexibility, data schema needs to be known and planned in advance (adjusting it later is difficult or maybe even impossible)
- Relations can lead to very complex queries with a lot of `JOIN` statements
- Horizontal scaling is hard, often only vertical scaling is possible - this means that we’ll face some growth limits (regarding throughput we can handle / performance) at some point

**NoSQL**:

- Increased flexibility might lead us to work sloppy and postpone data structure decisions
- Duplicate data means that we have to update multiple collections and documents if that data changes - not just one record in one table as we would do it in the SQL world

## When Might SQL be Best?

- We got related data, used in different **chunks** in different parts of our app, that changes relatively often (we would have to update multiple collections all the time in a NoSQL world)
- A clear schema is important to us and our data is unlikely to change (drastically)

## When Might NoSQL be Best?

- Exact data requirements or the data itself is unknown or subject to change / expand
- We require high (read) throughput but we won’t change our data that often (i.e. we don’t need to update dozens of documents for one change all the time)
- We need to scale our database horizontally (i.e. we store enormous amounts of data and have huge read and write throughput)

Obviously, we can structure our database in different ways. And depending on our structure, we might end up with a NoSQL database that mitigates some of the issues (e.g. we reduce the amount of duplicate write requests). The same is true for SQL databases: You can choose a structure that meets your data requirements and doesn’t lead to overly complicated `JOIN` statements.

## Working with MySQL

To work with databases, we need to download it from <https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>. We want to install the community version (GPL - last download link).

1. We choose `MySQL Installer for Windows` option, because we want to work with Windows and it automatically uses installer and tools.

2. Once we clicked on `MySQL Installer for Windows` link, we click on `No thanks, just start my download.` link.

3. Then we nned to choose MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. To do this we need to go to the `Choosing a Setup Type` section and choose the `Custom` option. Then press `Next` button.

4. Then we select the `MySQL Servers` option and we choose the latest version of MySQL Server (current version is 8.0.22 - X64) and click on right-arrow symbol (i.e. `→`) to add it into installation.

5. We also need to install MySQL Workbench, to do that, we need to goto the `Applications -> MySQL Workbench -> MySQL Workbench` path and we choose the latest version of MySQL Workbench (current version is 8.0.22 - X64) and click on right-arrow symbol (i.e. `→`) to add it into installation.

6. Then we click on `Next` (or `Execute`) button and we wait for downloading these packages and then we click on `Next` button again.

7. We click on `Next` button again. Then we don't need to change the setting. After that, we need to click on `Next` button again.

8. We choose the `Legacy Authentication...` option and click on `Next` button and we choose some password for root user and we click on `Next` button again.

9. We still need to clicking on `Next` button and then we need to click on `Execute` button and finish.

10. Finally we must click on `Next` button and all things done.

**Note**: In MAC or GNU/Linux we need to install MySQL Server and Workbench separately.

## Create our First Schema

To create our first schema, we need to go to the `MySQL Workbench` application and right click below **Schemas** and choose **Create Schema**. Then we choose a good name for that and click on `Apply` button.

**Note1**: We must use lower-case characters in our schemas name.

**Note2**: We set default value to Charset and Collation section.

**Note3**: You can also use official doc for MySQL installation in <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing>.

## Installing `mysql2` Package

We can work with database in Node environment by installing the `mysql2` package with `npm install --save mysql2` command.

Then we create a `database.js` file and import this package:

```js
const mysql = require("mysql2");

const pool = mysql.createPool({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root",
  database: "nodejs-step-by-step",
  password: "********"
});
```

We didn't use `createConnection()`, because we don't want a single connection, but a pool connections which will allows us to always reach out to it whenever we a query to run, then we get a new connection from that pool which manages multiple connections (we can run multiple queries simultaneously); because each query needs its own connection.

Indeed, connection pools help reduce the time spent connecting to the MySQL server by reusing a previous connection, leaving them open instead of closing when you are done with them.

Once the query is done, the connection will be handed back into the pool and it's available again for a new query and the pool can then be finished when our application shuts down.

Now the:

- `host`: This is the hostname of the database you are connecting to. (Default: localhost)
- `user`: The MySQL user to authenticate as (`"root"` for test)
- `database`: Name of the database to use for this connection
- `paasword`: The password of that MySQL user

We can export our pool with:

```js
module.exports = pool.promise();
```

This will allows us to use promises when working with these connections which of course handle asynchronous tasks (i.e. data) instead of callbacks. Because promises allow us to write code in a bit more structured way; we don't have many nested callbacks. We can also use promise chains and more features.

## Start our app and Work with MySQL

We import our database with `require()`:

```js
const db = require("./database");
db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

We can use `execute()`  method to write a query (we can also use `db.query()`, but `execute()` is better).

If we save our project, we would get an error, because we don't create a `products` table. To fix this error, we must create a `products` table in our MySQL Workbench.

To create a table, we need to click on our database (i.e. `nodejs-step-by-step`) and in table tab, right click on `Tables` and choose `Create Table...`. We need to add `id`, `title`, `price`, `description` and `imageUrl` column.

**Note**: We did it visually, but you can use ``INSERT INTO `nodejs-step-by-step`.`products` (`id`, `title`, `price`, `description`, `imageUrl`) VALUES ('1', 'A book', '29.99', 'A good book', 'image');`` query.

As we mentioned before, we can export our pool with `promise` mode or `module.exports = pool.promise();`, then we can use:

```js
db.execute("SELECT * FROM products").then().catch();
```

Now we can log our result into console with `console.log()`:

```js
db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

We can see few details when logging the result:

```js
db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result[0], result[1]);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

**Note1**: If we didn't use `.promise()` is `database.js` file, we would use `db.promise().execute(...)...`.

**Note2**: In working with SQL, we don't need the `fs` and `path` module, because we want to work with database.

We can only see our table details with next-gen **JavaScript**, destrucuring:

```js
function fetchDataDynamic() {
  db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
    .then(([rows, fields]) => {
      console.table(rows);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
}
```

Let's compare them:

```js
const db = require("./database");

fetchData(); // show all details
fetchDataDest(); // only show our table

function fetchData() {
  db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
    .then(result => {
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
}

function fetchDataDest() {
  db.execute("SELECT * FROM products")
    .then(([rows, fields]) => { // destructuring method
      console.table(rows);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
}
```

We used `console.table()` to it shows us a table:

```js
┌─────────┬────┬──────────┬───────┬───────────────┬──────────┐
│ (index) │ id │  title   │ price │  description  │ imageUrl │
├─────────┼────┼──────────┼───────┼───────────────┼──────────┤
│    0    │ 1  │ 'A book' │ 29.99 │ 'A good book' │ 'image'  │
└─────────┴────┴──────────┴───────┴───────────────┴──────────┘
```

## Inserting Data into Database

We can insert data into database with `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` kewords:

```js
const db = require("./database");

insertData();

function insertData() {
  db.execute(
    `INSERT INTO products (title, price, description, imageUrl) VALUES ("myTitle", 12.99, "myDescription", "myImage")`
  );
}
```

**Warning**: This way is not secure, we can use another way of inserting data into database. We can use `?` question mark here in `VALUES`:

```js
function insertData() {
  db.execute(
    `INSERT INTO products (title, price, description, imageUrl) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)`,
    ["myTitle", 12.99, "myDescription", "myImage"]
  );
}
```

With this way, no data injections will occur.

We can search precisely by writing `WHERE` keyword:

```js
function insertDataPrecise() {
  db.execute(`SELECT * FROM products WHERE products.id = ?`, [2]).then(([rows]) => {
    console.table(rows);
  })
}

┌─────────┬────┬───────────┬───────┬─────────────────┬───────────┐
│ (index) │ id │   title   │ price │   description   │ imageUrl  │
├─────────┼────┼───────────┼───────┼─────────────────┼───────────┤
│    0    │ 2  │ 'myTitle' │ 12.99 │ 'myDescription' │ 'myImage' │
└─────────┴────┴───────────┴───────┴─────────────────┴───────────┘
```
